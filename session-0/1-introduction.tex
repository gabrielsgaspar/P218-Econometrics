\begin{frame}{Advice}

    This is a PhD level course, so take it seriously.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Alexey will cover a lot of material and in great detail. It is perfectly fine if you don't understand everything in lecture.
        \item Look at different reference books if things are not clear.
        \item Feel free to email me with questions - I will try my best to help you.
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{2em}
    
    Problem sets are lengthy.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Start early. One week is not enough to properly complete a problem set (especially the later ones).
        \item Make sure you understand the concepts being covered.
    \end{itemize}
